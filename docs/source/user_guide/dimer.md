# Dimer method

The dimer method of {cite:t}`dm-henkelmanDimerMethodFinding1999` with
improvements by {cite:t}`dm-heydenEfficientMethodsFinding2005` and
{cite:t}`dm-kastnerSuperlinearlyConvergingDimer2008` for estimating the lowest
Eigenmode using only first derivatives.

An overview may be found in {cite:t}`dm-olsenComparisonMethodsFinding2004`.

The dimer separation is set in the **[Main]** section with the
`finiteDifference` parameter.

The method of {cite:t}`dm-melanderRemovingExternalDegrees2015` is also
implemented for use with gas phase systems.

```{note}
There is no point removing rotations for an extended system.
```

```{versionadded} 2.5_TBA
The Gaussian Process Regression accelerated dimer in C++, rewritten and extended from {cite:t}`dm-koistinenMinimumModeSaddle2020`.
```
